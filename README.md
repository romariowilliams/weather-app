## Disclaimer
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br/>
This project was created using the tutorial by Hamza Mizra:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204C9yNeOYI  <br/><br/>
After creating this project, I realized that Hamza also has this project on Github at: https://github.com/hamza-mirza/react-weather-app. I plan to redesign the app and fix bugs that exist 


## Setup
##### 1. Install nodejs and npm
##### 2. In the nodejs command prompt, navigate (`cd`) to the directory where you want to create the app.
##### 3. Install `create-react-app` if you don't have it installed yet 
```shell
npm install create-react-app -g
```
##### 4. Create the project:
```shell
create-react-app weather-app
```
##### 5. Copy and paste all the files from this repo into the project folder created by React. If prompted to replace any file or folder, select Yes. 

##### 6. In the nodejs command prompt, ensure navigate to the project folder, and run the app
```shell
npm start
```
##### 7. To stop the app, you can use `ctrl + c` to break the command, and confirm with Y
